# Brigade SDK for JavaScript Node-Based Example

__Note: This example uses TypeScript and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/).__

Running this example requires:

* [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* A running (local or remote) Brigade 2 API server. Please refer to Brigade's
  own documentation.
* A valid API token. Again, refer to Brigade's own documentation.

Define environment variables to hold the API server address and API token:

```console
$ export API_SERVER_ADDRESS=<address goes here>
$ export API_TOKEN=<token goes here>
```

To obtain all required dependencies, transpile the example TypeScript, and run
the example, all in one shot, navigate to this directory, then:
